# Python Backend with Next.js Frontend

## Description

This project is a full-stack application featuring a Python backend for robust server-side operations and authentication, coupled with a Next.js frontend for a powerful and responsive user interface. The backend handles authentication and API requests, while the frontend provides a seamless user experience.

## Features

- Secure authentication system
- RESTful API endpoints
- Server-side rendering with Next.js
- Responsive UI design
- (Add any other specific features of your project)

## Technologies

- Backend:
  - Python 3.x
  - Flask (or Django, FastAPI - specify your choice)
  - JWT for authentication
  - (Any other backend libraries/frameworks you're using)

- Frontend:
  - Next.js
  - React
  - (Any other frontend libraries you're using, e.g., Axios, SWR)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. Set up the backend:
   ```
   cd backend
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up the frontend:
   ```
   cd ../frontend
   npm install
   ```

4. Set up environment variables:
   - Create a `.env` file in the backend directory
   - Create a `.env.local` file in the frontend directory
   (Provide any necessary environment variables)

## Usage

1. Start the backend server:
   ```
   cd backend
   python app.py  # Or however you start your Python server
   ```

2. In a new terminal, start the frontend development server:
   ```
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

## API Endpoints

Document your API endpoints here. For example:

- `POST /api/auth/login`: Login endpoint
- `GET /api/users`: Fetch users (requires authentication)
- (Add other endpoints as necessary)

## Authentication

This project uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication. The flow is as follows:

1. User logs in through the frontend.
2. Backend validates credentials and returns a JWT.
3. Frontend stores the JWT (preferably in an HTTP-only cookie).
4. JWT is sent with subsequent requests to authenticate.

(Add any other relevant details about your authentication system)
